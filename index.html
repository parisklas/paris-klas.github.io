    <h2>What We've Been Up To This Week</h2>
      <p>This week, we've been exploring North Carolina!</p>
      <p>It was unbearably hot in Charlotte. With temperatures in the high 90s and humidity making it feel like it's in the 100s, we couldn't even stay in the van! After getting a hotel for a night, we decided to move on and check out the mountains in the hopes it would cool down. We were pleasantly surprised with Asheville, NC. Not only is the weather supremely enjoyable, but the city itself has so much character and cool things to discover.</p>
